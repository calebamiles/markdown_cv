## Overview
I am a graduate of Claremont McKenna College where I obtained a dual degree in Physics and Mathematics.
It is my goal to work on exceptionally challenging computational problems in applied science. I am very excited by the advancements in the use of computers in the modeling of complex physical systems and am very interested in creating software that enables computational exploration of the physical world; and I am dedicated to the development of open source software because I believe that software, like ideas, are best when shared openly.
